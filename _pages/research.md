<b>Loss and regret aversion in survey design (In progress)</b><br> 
As a researcher who would like to get the most responses from the prize money that they promised to reward to participants, they could utilize some behavioral economic theory to guide the survey design. I propose three possible approaches that could be applied individually or simultaneously.

<b>The effect of Trucking industry Deregulation on Truck Drivers' Wage</b><br> 
[[paper](/files/trucking.pdf)] <br>
We assess the impact of intrastate trucking industry deregulation on the for-hire sector market.  In the 1980s, several states removed regulation on intrastate truck transportation, which intensified competition, and had a tremendous impact on the market structure of the trucking industry and the labor market of truck drivers.  We use the difference in difference specification to identify the effect of deregulation of intrastate trucking industry on the trucking market and for-hire sector drivers wage. We found that the deregulation reduced truck drivers wage by 7.64% and drivers whose wage is near the median of the wage distribution are affected the most severely; their wage was reduced by 12% - 15%. We also found that about 66.54% for-hire sector drivers either switched to other occupations or lost their job, and 69% of companies were forced out of business.
