<b>Durable Spending during the Covid-19 Pandemic (In progress)</b><br> 
  [[paper](/files/ss.pdf)] <br>
Previous studies find that households spend about 25 percent of their 2001 and 2008 rebates on nondurable consumptions. The majority of the fiscal stimulus would be either saved or used to pay off debt. However, most empirical researches found that durable consumptions are not very responsive to fiscal stimulus, especially during recessions. This contradicts the observation of the 2020 stimulus payment. We see a decrease in durable spending at the beginning of the pandemic and a quick recovery to a much higher level than the pre-pandemic. We propose a model incorporating household production and working from home to explain this unusual increase in durable spending and document the heterogeneous reaction among households. 

<b>The impact of Covid on small business : From foot traffic data  (In progress)</b><br> 
The Covid pandemic has a disproportionally negative impact on local small businesses.  Small businesses are more vulnerable to negative economic shocks; it is usually more challenging for them to get help and fully recover from shocks. Even though the federal government offers forgivable paycheck protection program (PPP) loans to them,  there are still a significant amount of local vendors who went out of business during the past twelve months. We are trying to use foot traffic data from safegraph to answer which business is the most vulnerable and needs help the most. 

<b>Loss and regret aversion in survey design (In progress)</b><br> 
As a researcher who would like to get the most responses from the prize money that they promised to reward to participants, they could utilize some behavioral economic theory to guide the survey design. I propose three possible approaches that could be applied individually or simultaneously.



<b>The effect of Trucking industry Deregulation on Truck Drivers' Wage</b><br> 
[[paper](/files/trucking.pdf)] <br>
We assess the impact of intrastate trucking industry deregulation on the for-hire sector market.  In the 1980s, several states removed regulation on intrastate truck transportation, which intensified competition, and had a tremendous impact on the market structure of the trucking industry and the labor market of truck drivers.  We use the difference in difference specification to identify the effect of deregulation of intrastate trucking industry on the trucking market and for-hire sector drivers wage. We found that the deregulation reduced truck drivers wage by 7.64% and drivers whose wage is near the median of the wage distribution are affected the most severely; their wage was reduced by 12% - 15%. We also found that about 66.54% for-hire sector drivers either switched to other occupations or lost their job, and 69% of companies were forced out of business.
