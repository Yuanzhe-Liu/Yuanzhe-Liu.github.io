<b>Durable Spending during the Covid-19 Pandemic (In progress)</b><br> 
  [[paper](/files/ss.pdf)] <br>
I decompose the durable good consumption increase during 2020-2021 using a household production model with working-from-home. Durable good consumption is susceptible to business cycles; in past recessions, durable good consumption either decreased or slowed down. However, durable good consumption was very robust during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. I build a household production model with working from home and estimate the model using a Bayesian approach. Using Kalman smoother, we can then decompose the increase in durable good consumption into different channels. Working from home can account for up to one-third of the durable good consumption increase, and substitution between nondurable and durable can account for another one-third of the increase. 

<b>The impact of Covid on small business : From foot traffic data  (In progress)</b><br> 
The Covid pandemic has a disproportionally negative impact on local small businesses.  Small businesses are more vulnerable to negative economic shocks; it is usually more challenging for them to get help and fully recover from shocks. Even though the federal government offers forgivable paycheck protection program (PPP) loans to them,  there are still a significant amount of local vendors who went out of business during the past twelve months. We are trying to use foot traffic data from safegraph to answer which business is the most vulnerable and needs help the most. 

<b>Loss and regret aversion in survey design (In progress)</b><br> 
As a researcher who would like to get the most responses from the prize money that they promised to reward to participants, they could utilize some behavioral economic theory to guide the survey design. I propose three possible approaches that could be applied individually or simultaneously.



<b>The effect of Trucking industry Deregulation on Truck Drivers' Wage</b><br> 
[[paper](/files/trucking.pdf)] <br>
We assess the impact of intrastate trucking industry deregulation on the for-hire sector market.  In the 1980s, several states removed regulation on intrastate truck transportation, which intensified competition, and had a tremendous impact on the market structure of the trucking industry and the labor market of truck drivers.  We use the difference in difference specification to identify the effect of deregulation of intrastate trucking industry on the trucking market and for-hire sector drivers wage. We found that the deregulation reduced truck drivers wage by 7.64% and drivers whose wage is near the median of the wage distribution are affected the most severely; their wage was reduced by 12% - 15%. We also found that about 66.54% for-hire sector drivers either switched to other occupations or lost their job, and 69% of companies were forced out of business.
